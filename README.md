# PoE Checklist

** Note: I'm no longer maintaining this website. ** It sounds like PoE 3.9 will change the map system substantially, so the current system would need to be rethought. Feel free to fork this repository and rehost it if you wish. The map screenshots at /src/copy/maps might still be useful.

This is the source code for PoE Checklist - an interactive Path of Exile checklist for maps, passive quests, lab trials and pantheons.

Path of Exile is an ARPG game made by Grinding Gear Games, [check it out here](http://www.pathofexile.com/).
